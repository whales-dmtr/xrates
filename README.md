## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# This project requires Python 3.13.5
# You can install it from the official Python website
# or using pyenv:
pyenv install 3.13.5

# Start the database
# The easiest way is to use Docker:
docker run --name xrates-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=xrates -d -p 5432:5432 postgres

# If you don't have Docker installed,
# you'll need to install PostgreSQL manually and create the database

# Start the Redis server 
# Again, you can run it with Docker or manually:
docker run --name xrates-cache -d -p 6379:6379 redis

# Create a .env file
# Make sure you're in the root directory of the project

# If you used the Docker command above,
# you can simply copy the .env file mentioned in the Installation section,
# but you need to change DJANGO_DEBUG to 1 (for development mode)

# If you created the database manually or run the Redis server manually,
# copy the template from .env.example, fill in the values, and continue

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
python3.13 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
python3 xrates/manage.py runserver
```
